## About Me

Hi there! I'm Mei Lin MTFBWY, a digital strategist, AI enthusiast, and lifelong learner with a passion for empowering communities and exploring the limits of technology. 
When I’m not teaching, learning, or leading transformative projects, I’m probably creating fun programs for youth or thinking about how AI can solve everyday problems (or maybe eating dumplings, who knows).

Here’s a quick glimpse into my world:

- Advocate for AAPI empowerment, gender equity, and technology education.
- Champion of AI transformation (and a proud Microsoft CoPilot 365 MVP).
- Author of *Mommy is a Project Manager* (parenthood + PM = bright ideas).
- Mother to a young creative future Jedi (who's got more energy than my coffee!).
- Builder of communities, PMOs, and sometimes even Minecraft backpacks.

# This Repository

This repository is inspired by my curiosity-driven life and my belief in continuous learning. Whether you're here to:
- Learn about future of project management especially in AI / Copilot.
- Explore new ideas with GitHub.
- Start my journey in tech or project management.

I’m here to learn, explore, and grow. Every line of code and every commit brings me closer to becoming confident in GitHub!
